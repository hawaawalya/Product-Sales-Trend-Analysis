# Product-Sales-Trend-Analysis

üìä This project focuses on analyzing product sales trends using modern data analysis techniques.  
The aim is to understand **patterns, seasonality, and anomalies** in retail sales data while applying structured analytical frameworks.

## üîç Project Overview
This repository contains the workflow and methodology used to analyze product sales trends.  
Rather than focusing only on the final results, the emphasis here is on the **frameworks, methods, and tools** that can be applied to similar datasets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Frameworks
### 1. Data Understanding & Preparation
- Cleaning missing values & anomalies.
- Handling duplicates.
- Standardizing categorical values (e.g., product categories, city names).
- Ensuring time-series consistency.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, distribution).
- Segmentation by product, city, and time period.
- Outlier detection and anomaly checks.

### 3. Trend & Seasonality Analysis
- Time series decomposition.
- Rolling averages.
- Identifying demand cycles.

### 4. Visualization
- Power BI dashboards.
- Comparative charts (line, bar, pie).
- Scatter plots for correlations.

## üßë‚Äçüíº Business Analysis (Technical Test Style)
This section frames the analysis **from the perspective of a stakeholder or store manager**, focusing on *practical business questions*.

### A. Data Understanding & Cleaning
1. **Are there any errors or anomalies in the Excel file?**  
   - Example 1: Negative quantity values ‚Üí should be corrected or removed.  
   - Example 2: Wrong date format (e.g., text instead of date) ‚Üí convert to proper date field.
     
2. **Are there any duplicate records?**  
   - If duplicates exist, count them and keep only unique transaction IDs.  
   - Example: Out of 10,000 records, 120 might be duplicates ‚Üí remove them to avoid revenue inflation.



### B. Descriptive Analysis
3. **Total Revenue (Jan‚ÄìMar 2024):**  
   - Sum of `Quantity √ó Price` across all products in this period.  

4. **Most Frequently Purchased Product & City:**  
   - Identify the product with the highest sales count.  
   - Break down by city to see geographic concentration.  

5. **Most Frequently Used Payment Method:**  
   - Check mode distribution (e.g., Credit Card, E-wallet, Cash).  

6. **Top 5 Customers by Purchase Value:**  
   - Rank customers by total spending.  

7. **Month with Highest Revenue:**  
   - Example: March shows peak revenue.  
   - Possible reasons: promotional campaign, seasonal demand, or school holidays.

### C. Problem Solving & Business Insight
8. **Which product to promote next month?**  
   - Choose based on:  
     - High demand but low margin ‚Üí upsell/cross-sell.  
     - Or high margin but under-promoted ‚Üí maximize profitability.  

9. **Interesting Purchasing Pattern:**  
   - Example: Bundling pattern ‚Üí customers often buy Product A with Product B.  
   - Recommendation: Offer bundle discounts to boost sales.  

10. **2 Key Metrics to Monitor Monthly:**  
   - **Revenue Growth %** ‚Üí track overall business health.  
   - **Repeat Purchase Rate** ‚Üí measure customer loyalty and retention.  

## üìà Analytical Frameworks Used
**1. CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)**
